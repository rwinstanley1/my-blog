      <h2>The Leeds Beer Scene</h2>
        <p>Leeds used to be known for Tetleys and classic bitters. While there are still loads of classic pubs, Leeds has turned into a craft-beer mecca in recent years.
        <p>Leeds has become the 'beer capital of the North',with everything from traditional pubs like Whitelocks, to tap rooms like
          Meanwood Terminus. There is almost too much choice, so here are some of the best places to check out.</p>
